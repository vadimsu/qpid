Qpid Proton Developer Information
=================================

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
=======================

To setup the variables for your development environment, simply source
the file $REPO/config.sh:

  $ source config.sh

This file sets the needed environment variables for all supported dynamic
languages (Python, Perl, Ruby, PHP) as well as for Java and for testing. It,
by default, assumes that you're building Proton in the directory:

  $REPO/build

where $REPO points the location where the Proton Subversion or Git repo has
been checked out.

If, however, you use a different location for your build files, then you'll want
to set the environment variable CPROTON_BUILD to point to it first. So, for
example, if you're building in:

  /home/yourname/devel/proton/cmake

then you would have the following environment variable set:

  $ export CPROTON_BUILD=/hojme/yourname/devel/proton/cmake/proton-c

NOTE: You need to point the environment variable to the proton-c directory under
where your build is done.
